## About the project
Welcome to our Interactive Dashboards project! This dashboard have been created as a fourth project for Data Visualization course. Our idea was to create visually appeling dashboard that would allow users to explore the world of Pokémon in a fun and interactive way.

The dashboard comprises three distinct sections, each offering a unique set of features:
- On the first page, users can construct their own Pokemon teams by selecting six Pokémon from a list of all available creatures. The dashboard then provides a visual representation of the team's average statistics, allowing users to quickly assess the strengths and weaknesses of their team.
- The second page hosts an encyclopedia of Pokémon, allowing user to go through the generations, look for their favorite Pokémon and see their stats. The table is interactive and allows for sorting.
- The third page introduces a Pokemon comparison functionality, allowing users to compare various Pokémon based on their statistics.
